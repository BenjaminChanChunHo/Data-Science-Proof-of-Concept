# Data Science Proof of Concept
I am [Benjamin Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-chan-chun-ho), a researcher and practitioner in statistics. I realize that there are numerous academic researchers that present elegant theories. In the meanwhile, many data scientists focus more on data and results without enough rigor. With personal experience in data science and machine learning, I aspire to bridge the gap, even if not by much, by emphasizing both theories and practicalities in real-world problems.

Each Python notebook is created to illustrate a concept through theoretical and empirical proof. The empirical proof can be in the form of simulation, data and use case study. The code is readily available for application. If you would like to make a suggestion or contribute to this initiative, please feel free to email me at benjaminchanchunho@gmail.com.
