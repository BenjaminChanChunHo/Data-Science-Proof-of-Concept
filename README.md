# Data Science Proof of Concept
I am [Benjamin Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-chan-chun-ho), a researcher and practitioner in statistics. I have realized that there are numerous academic researchers presenting elegant theories. In the meanwhile, many data scientists focus on data and results without enough rigour. With personal experience in data science and machine learning, I aspire to bridge the gap, even if not by much, by emphasizing both theories and practicalities in solving real-world problems.

Each Python notebook is created to illustrate a concept through theoretical and empirical proof. The empirical proof can be in the form of simulation, data and use case study. Any code is readily available for further application. If you would like to contribute to this initiative, please feel free to email me at benjaminchanchunho@gmail.com.
